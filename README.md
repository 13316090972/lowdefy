## Quick start

Run:

```bash
npx lowdefy@latest init && npx lowdefy@latest dev
```

This will create a file called `lowdefy.yaml` in the current working directory that contains the configuration for a Lowdefy app (as well as a `.gitignore`) and launch a local development server at http://localhost:3000. Make changes in the `lowdefy.yaml` file to see them reflect in the app.

            Lowdefy simplifies creating software that helps manage internal data - think web apps, admin panels, BI dashboards, CRUD and workflow apps. Within most companies the need exist to connect to a variety of data sources and execute actions on such data. This must be done without compromising data security while respecting complex data integrity rules.

            Lowdefy aims to enable companies to better control and monitor business data, by simplifying the process of creating internal tools. Lowdefy makes these tools easy to build, change and maintain.

            ## Quickstart

          vars:
            id: quickstart
            command: 'npx lowdefy@latest init && npx lowdefy@latest dev'

            This will create a file called `lowdefy.yaml` in the current working directory that contains the configuration for a Lowdefy app (as well as a `.gitignore`) and launch a local development server at http://localhost:3000. Make changes in the `lowdefy.yaml` file to see them reflect in the app.

            ### Create internal tools by only writing simple, readable YAML

            Using Lowdefy means all the complicated parts of developing your own web app are taken care of, allowing you to focus on the pure business logic. This allows you to move quickly, while still having an app that conforms to industry best practices.

            The Lowdefy config schema is easy to learn, understand and remember. In order to achieve this, we aim to be consistent in how things work so that you predict how an app will behave by simply reading the config.

            ### Work with your data where it is stored

            Lowdefy apps can connect to multiple data bases, APIs and apps. Day to day business requires people working with data which is stored in a variety of different data bases and applications.

            Too often data is exported, duplicated and lost, creating additional risk. Lowdefy only runs your application config, and does not store any data, but rather connects to your data sources.

            ### Build future proof web applications on a open-source platform

            Lowdefy is a open-source Apache-2 licensed project, free from vendor lock-in. Our business model is to build optional "nice-to-have" services best suited for Lowdefy applications, enriching the Lowdefy ecosystem.

            Since Lowdefy apps are easy to manage in a Git repository, we hope to see many community open-source Lowdefy apps in the future.

            ### Deploy your Lowdefy app as you like

            Host your Lowdefy app in your own environment as a docker image or even on Netlify using serverless functions. Serving a Lowdefy app, requires a the Lowdefy graphQl server and hosting the Lowdefy React app and blocks.

            The Lowdefy front-end makes use of Webpack module federation to serve blocks and assemble your Lowdefy app as a micro-front-end solution. Developing your own custom front-end React blocks makes Lowdefy apps truly expandable.

    description: |
      The `Link` action is used to link a user to another page. An input can be passed to the next page using either the
      `urlQuery`, which is visible to the user, but persists if the browser is refreshed, or by using the `input` object, which is not
      visible to the user.
    params: |
      ###### string
      The pageId of a page in the app to link to.

      ###### object
      - `pageId: string`: The pageId of a page in the app to link to.
      - `home: boolean`: Link to the home page. This is either the configured public or authenticated homepage, or the first page in the default menu visible to the user.
      - `url: string`: Link to an external url.
      - `newWindow: boolean`: Open the link in a new window.
      - `input: object`: Object to set as the input for the linked page.
      - `urlQuery: object`: Object to set as the urlQuery for the linked page.

      ```

      ###### Link to home page:

      - id: link_home
        type: Link
        params:
          home: true
      ```

      ###### Link to an external url:
      ```yaml
      - id: link_url
        type: Link

        params:
          pageId: my_page_id
          newWindow: true
      ```

      ###### Set the urlQuery of the page that is linked to:

        type: Link
        params:
          pageId: my_page_id
          urlQuery:
            id:
              _state: id

        type: Link
        params:

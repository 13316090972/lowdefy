            The `SetGlobal` action sets values to the `global` object. It takes an object as parameters, and sets each of those values to the `global` object.
            This is useful if you need to set a value that needs to be available across multiple pages in the app, like the id of a currently selected
            object. `SetGlobal` works just like `SetState`, except it sets to the `global` object and not `state`.


            ### Parameters
            - values: Object with key value pairs to set in global.


            ### Examples

            Set a single value to global:

            ```
            - id: set_selected_company
              type: SetGlobal
              params:
                selected_selected_company:
                  _state: company.id
            ```

            Set multiple values to state:
            ```
            - id: multiple_values
              type: SetGlobal
              params:
                firstName: Monica
                lastName: Geller
                address:
                  street: 90 Bedford St
                  city: New York
                  zipCode: '10014'
                  country: US
                friends:
                  - Ross Geller
                  - Rachel Green
                  - Chandler Bing
                  - Phoebe Buffay
                  - Joey Tribbiani
            ```

            Using dot notation:

            ```
            - id: dot_notation
              type: SetGlobal

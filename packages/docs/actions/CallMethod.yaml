            The `CallMethod` action is used to call a method defined by another block.

            ### Parameters
            - `blockId`: _String_ - The id of the block.
            - `method`: _String_ - The name of the method that should be called.
            - `args`: _Any_ - The arguments with which the method should be called. If this is an array, each item will be a positional argument to the method, else the args are only the first argument. (The arguments are spread if they are an array).

            ### Examples

            Open a modal:
            ```
            - id: toggle_modal
              type: CallMethod
              params:
                blockId: my_modal
                method: toggleOpen
            ```

            Display a message with args:
            ```
            - id: display_message
              type: CallMethod
              params:
                blockId: my_message
                method: open
                args:
                  content: Hello
                  duration: 4
            ```

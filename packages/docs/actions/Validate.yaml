    description: |
      The `Validate` action is used to validate a users input, usually before information is inserted into a database using a request.
      It is used in conjunction with the `required` and `validate` fields on input blocks. If the validation fails, the `Validate`
      action will fail, and this will stop the execution of actions that are defined after it.

      The first time a `Validate` action is called, validation error are shown to the user. The `Reset` action resets this.

      Validate only validates the input blocks that are inside the context it is called from. Therefore, if you use two contexts
      to separate two forms, only the one form will be validated.

    params: |
      ###### void
      The `Validate` action validates all blocks in the `context ` if called without params.

      ###### string
      A blockId of the block to validate.

      ###### string[]
      An array of blockIds of the blocks to validate.

    examples: |
      ###### Validate all inputs in the context:
      ```yaml
      - id: validate
        type: Validate
      ```

      ###### Validate a single input:
      ```yaml
      - id: validate_one
        type: Validate
        params: my_text_input
      ```

      ###### Validate a list of inputs:
      ```yaml
      - id: validate_one
        type: Validate
        params:
          - my_text_input_1
          - my_text_input_2
      ```

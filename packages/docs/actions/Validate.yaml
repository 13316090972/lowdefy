            The `Validate` action is used to validate a users input, usually before information is inserted into a database using a mutation.
            It is used in conjunction with the `required` and `validate` fields on input blocks. If the validation fails, the `Validate`
            action will fail, and this will stop the execution of actions that are defined after it.

            The first time a `Validate` action is called, validation error are shown to the user. The `Reset` action resets this.

            Validate only validates the input blocks that are inside the context it is called from. Therefore, if you use two contexts
            to separate two forms, only the one form will be validated.

            ### Parameters
            `Validate` can be called without any parameters to validate all input blocks in the context. It can also be called with a list of blockIds or a single blockId to validate.

            ### Examples

            Validate all inputs in the context:

            ```
            - id: validate
              type: Validate
            ```

            Validate a single input:
            ```
            - id: validate_one
              type: Validate
              params: my_text_input
            ```

            Validate a list of inputs:
            ```
            - id: validate_one
              type: Validate
              params:
                - my_text_input_1
                - my_text_input_2
            ```

            Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial and built a sort-of functioning app.

            To carry on from here, you have a couple of options

            ### Join the community

            At our [Github Discussions](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy/discussions) page you can get help with any problems you have, share you ideas, ask questions, and show off the apps you have built.

            ### Understand the concepts

            To get a more in-depth understanding of how everything works, you can start [here](/overview).

            ### Play with blocks

            The docs have an interactive playground where you can adjust a block's properties and see how that affects the block in real time. Go look at what you can do with a [`Button`](/Button).

            ### Look at an example app

            One of the best ways to learn is by doing things for yourself. You can clone an example app that is similar to something you want to build, and start experimenting from there.

            ###### CRUD example

            This example is a simple app that has everything needed to get started managing data in a database.

            ###### Survey example

            A simple survey example.

            ###### Ticketing system example

            An ticketing system with action history.

            ###### Movies example

            An example reporting dashboard app based on a movies database.

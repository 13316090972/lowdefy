            Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial and built a sort-of functioning app.

            To carry on from here, you have a couple of options

            # Look at an example app

            One of the best ways to learn is by doing things for yourself. You can clone an example app that is similar to something you want to build, and start experimenting from there.

            #### CRUD example

            This example is a simple app app that has everything needed to get started managing data in a database.

            #### Survey example

            A simple survey example.

            #### Movies example

            A example reporting dashboard app based on a movies database.

            # Understand the concepts

            To get a more in-depth understanding of how everything works, you can start [here](/context).

            # Play with blocks

            The docs have an interactive playground where you can adjust a block's properties and see how that affects the block in real time. Go look at what you can do with a [`Button`](/Button).

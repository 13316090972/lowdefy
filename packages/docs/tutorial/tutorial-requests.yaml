            ### Creating a Google Sheet and getting credentials

            #### Step 1

            Go to [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets) and create a new Google sheet.

            #### Step 2

            Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with the same Google account.

            #### Step 3

            Click on the "Select a project" dropdown at the top left, and then choose "NEW PROJECT". Give your project a name and click "Create".

            #### Step 4

            Click on the "Go to APIs overview" button, and the click "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES".

            #### Step 5

            Search for "Sheets" and select the Google Sheets API.

            #### Step 6

            Click "Enable".

            #### Step 7

            Click "CREATE CREDENTIALS".

            #### Step 8

            Choose the following:
            - **Which API are you using?**: Google Sheets API
            - **Where will you be calling the API from?** : Web server (e.g. node.js, Tomcat)
            - **What data will you be accessing?**: Application data
            - **Are you planning to use this API with App Engine or Compute Engine?**: No, I'm not using them

            Then click "What credentials do I need?"

            #### Step 9

            Choose the following:
            - Give the account a name.
            - Chose "Project > Editor" as the role.
            - Choose JSON as the key type.

            Click continue.

            #### Step 10

            You will be asked to save a file. This file contains the credentials to access your sheet, so make sure to handle it securely. Download the file.

            #### Step 11

            Create a file called `.env` in your project directory with the following:

            ##### `.env`
            ```
            LOWDEFY_SECRET_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL="__YOUR_CLIENT_EMAIL__"
            LOWDEFY_SECRET_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY="__YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY__"
            ```

            Fill in the `client_email` and `private_key` values from your credentials JSON file (with the quotes). This will give the development server access to these secrets.
      - id: alert1
        type: Alert
        properties:
          type: warning
          showIcon: false
          message: The .env file contains your credentials. Do not commit this file to git. It should be listed in your .gitignore file if you started from the project template.
      - id: md2
        type: Markdown
        style:
          '.markdown-body':
            fontSize: 14px
        properties:
          content: |
            #### Step 12

            Because we changed the environment variables, we need to restart the dev server. Press "Ctrl + c" in the terminal, and run `npx @lowdefy/cli dev` again to restart the server.

            #### Step 13

            To be able to use these secrets in our live app, we also need to add them in Netlify. Go to your project on Netlify. Go to "Site settings", then "Build and deploy" in the left menu. Scroll down and select "Edit variables" in the "Environment" section.

            #### Step 14

            Add the same variables (`LOWDEFY_SECRET_SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL` and `LOWDEFY_SECRET_SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY`) with their values and save.

            #### Step 15

            We need to give our service account access to our Google Sheet. Go to your Google Sheet and click the "Share" button. Share the sheet with the client email of the service account we just created, with the "Editor" role.

            ### What happened

            We created a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, and created a service account in that project that we can use to access Google sheets. This gave us the credentials we need for the [`GoogleSheet`](/GoogleSheet) connection.

            We set up these credentials for our local dev environment using a `.env` file, and for our Netlify app using the Netlify console.

            ### Using the Google Sheets connection

            ### Step 1

            To use a Google Sheet with the Lowdefy connection, we first need to define the columns in the sheet. This will be the same fields as the data we will be saving later.

            In the first row of your sheet, add the following column headers:

            - meeting_name
            - number_of_attendees
            - meeting_room
            - date
            - start_time
            - end_time

            #### Step 2

            In your `lowdefy.yaml` file, add the following:

            ##### `lowdefy.yaml`

            ```
            name: lowdefy-project-template
            version: CURRENT_LOWDEFY_VERSION

            ################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
            connections:
              - id: google_sheet
                type: GoogleSheet
                properties:
                  client_email:
                    _secret: SHEETS_CLIENT_EMAIL
                  private_key:
                    _secret: SHEETS_PRIVATE_KEY
                  sheetIndex: 0
                  spreadsheetId: __YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID__
                  write: true
            ################ ------- Copy to here ----------- ################

            menus:
              # ...
            ```

            #### Step 3

            Note down your spreadsheetId. You can find this by looking at the url in your browser when you are looking at your sheet. It should look something like:

            `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{spreadsheetId}/edit#gid=0`

            where the spreadsheetId is a 44 character random string. Fill in your spreadsheetId in the spreadsheet connection.

            #### Step 4

            In your `booking.yaml` file, add the following request:

            ##### `pages/booking.yaml`

            ```yaml
            id: booking
            type: PageHeaderMenu
            properties:
              title: Book meeting
            layout:
              contentJustify: center # Center the contents of the page
            ################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
            requests:
              - id: save_data
                type: GoogleSheetAppendOne
                connectionId: google_sheet
                properties:
                  row:
                    meeting_name:
                      _state: meeting_name
                    number_of_attendees:
                      _state: number_of_attendees
                    meeting_room:
                      _state: meeting_room
                    date:
                      _state: date
                    start_time:
                      _state: start_time
                    end_time:
                      _state: end_time
            ################ ------- Copy to here ----------- ################
            blocks:
              # ...
            ```

            #### Step 5

            In your `booking.yaml` file, add the following action to the submit button:

            ##### `pages/booking.yaml`

            ```yaml
            id: booking
            # ...
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                # ...
                blocks:
                  - id: page_heading
                    # ...
                    # ...
                    # ...
                  - id: submit_button
                    type: Button
                    #...
                    actions:
                      onClick:
                        - id: validate
                          type: Validate
                        ################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
                        - id: save_data # Make a request to Google Sheets
                          type: Request
                          params: save_data
                        - id: reset # Reset the form once data has been submitted
                          type: Reset
                        ################ ------- Copy to here ----------- ################
            ```

            #### Step 6

            If you click the submit button, you should see your data submitted to your Google Sheet.

            ### What happened

            We set up the column names we will be using in our Google Sheet. We need to do this to use the `GoogleSheet` connection.

            We defined the `GoogleSheet` connection we will be using in our app, using the credentials we obtained earlier.

            We also defined a `GoogleSheetAppendOne` request, to save the data to our sheet, and called that request when clicking the submit button.

            ### Up next

            We would like to be able to see what data has been saved. In the next section we will create a page where we can see all the meetings that have been booked.

            #### Step 1

            Go to your project repository on Github, and navigate to `pages/welcome.yaml` in the repository files.

            This file contains the configuration for the welcome page on the app. It describes the UI components, called "blocks", as well as the actions on the page.

            #### Step 2

            To edit this configuration, click on the edit (pencil) icon at the top right. Paste the following text in the text area to replace the existing configuration:
            ```
            id: welcome
            type: PageHeaderMenu
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                type: Card
                blocks:
                  - id: title
                    type: Title
                    properties:
                      content: Hello World
            ```
            #### Step 3

            To save these changes, we are going to make a commit in the project repository.
      - id: md2
        type: Markdown
        style:
          '.markdown-body':
            fontSize: 14px
        properties:
          content: |
            Write a message to describe the changes you have made, choose the option to create a new branch, and click "Propose changes". Then click "Create pull request".

            #### Step 4

            You should see Netlify start to run a set of tests on your app. Netlify will create a deploy preview. This is a version of your site where you can preview changes made to the app before you make them live. Wait for the preview deployment to finish.

            #### Step 5

            Click on the "Details" link of the deploy/netlify check to go to your deploy preview. You should see something like this:
      - id: example1
        type: PageHeaderMenu
        properties:
          style:
            minHeight: 300px
          menu:
            links:
              - id: welcome
                type: MenuLink
                properties:
                  title: welcome
                url: ''
        blocks:
          - id: example1_content_card
            type: Card
            blocks:
              - id: example1_title
                type: Title
                properties:
                  content: Hello World
      - id: md3
        type: Markdown
        style:
          '.markdown-body':
            fontSize: 14px
        properties:
          content: |
            #### Step 6

            If you have reviewed your changes and you are happy with the result, go back and merge the pull request on Github. This will trigger Netlify to deploy those changes to the "live" version of your app.

            ### Up next

            In the next section we will run a local development server.

            In this tutorial we will be creating a simple ticketing app, that allow users to file new tickets, and see a list of outstanding tickets. We will be hosting this app with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

            ### Requirements

            You will need to have the following:

            - A Github account. You can create one [here](https://github.com/join).
            - A Netlify account. You can create one [here](https://app.netlify.com/signup). It is easiest if you sign up with your Github account.

            #### Step 1

            Create a new Lowdefy project using the Lowdefy project template.

            - Go to [https://github.com/lowdefy/project-template](https://github.com/lowdefy/project-template).
            - Click the "Use this template" button.
            - Give your project a name and create your project repository.

            #### Step 2

            Link your Github project to Netlify.

            - Once logged in to Netlify, click the "New site from git" button.
            - Choose Github, and authorise Netlify to access your repositories.
            - Select your repository.

      - id: alert1
        type: Alert
        properties:
          type: info
          showIcon: false
          message: If your repository isn't found, click "Configure Netlify on Github", and give Netlify access to your repository.
      - id: md2
        type: MarkdownWithHtml
        properties:
          content: |
            #### Step 3

            Configure your Netlify deployment.

            - Set your build command to `npx @lowdefy/cli build-netlify`.
            - Set your publish directory to `.lowdefy/publish`.
            - Review the other settings, and deploy your site
      - id: alert2
        type: Alert
        properties:
          type: warning
          showIcon: false
          message: Your site won't work yet. You first need to configure the Lowdefy backend server in the next step.
      - id: md3
        type: MarkdownWithHtml
        properties:
          content: |
            #### Step 4

            Configure the Lowdefy backend server.

            - Click the "Site settings" button.
            - Choose the "Functions" section in the left menu.
            - Edit the settings and set your functions directory to `.lowdefy/functions`.

            #### Step 5

            Redeploy your site.

            - Go to the "Deploys" tab.
            - Click the "Trigger deploy" button and deploy your site.
            - Wait for you site to finish deploying.

            #### Step 6

            Go to your shiny new app. On the "Site overview" tab you will find your site url. Go to this url and you should see something like this:
      - id: example1
        type: PageHeaderMenu
        properties:
          style:
            minHeight: 300px
          menu:

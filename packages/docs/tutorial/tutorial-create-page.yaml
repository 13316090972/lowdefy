            Let's create a page for a form where users can log a new ticket.

            #### Step 1

            Create a new YAML file in the pages directory called `new-ticket.yaml`, with the following content:

            ```yaml
            id: new-ticket
            type: PageHeaderMenu
            properties:
              title: New ticket # The title in the browser tab.
            layout:
              contentJustify: center # Center the contents of the page.
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                type: Card
                layout:
                  size: 800 # Set the size of the card so it does not fill the full screen.
                  contentGutter: 16 # Make a 16px gap between all blocks in this card.
                blocks:
                  - id: page_heading
                    type: Title
                    properties:
                      content: Log a ticket # The content text of the title block.
                      level: 3 # Make the title a little smaller (an html `<h3>`).
            ```

            #### Step 2

            Change the `lowdefy.yaml` to look like this:

            ```yaml
            name: lowdefy-project-template
            lowdefy: CURRENT_LOWDEFY_VERSION # e.g. 3.4.0

            pages:
              - _ref: pages/welcome.yaml
              - _ref: pages/new-ticket.yaml
            ```
      - id: alert1
        type: Alert
        properties:
          type: warning
          showIcon: false
          message: Make sure that the lowdefy field is the current latest Lowdefy version. This should be what is was when you created the project.
      - id: md2
        type: Markdown
        properties:
          content: |
            #### Step 3

            Your browser should reload, and you should see a link in the header menu to the booking page. If you click on that link it should take you to a page that looks like this:
      - id: example1
        type: PageHeaderMenu
        layout:
          contentJustify: center
        properties:
          style:
            minHeight: 300px
          menu:
            links:
              - id: welcome
                type: MenuLink
                properties:
                  title: welcome
              - id: new-ticket
                properties:
                  title: new-ticket
                type: MenuLink
        blocks:
          - id: content_card
            type: Card
            layout:
              size: 600
            blocks:
              - id: page_heading
                type: Title
                properties:
                  content: Log a ticket
                  level: 3
      - id: md3
        type: MarkdownWithCode
        properties:
          content: |
            #### Step 4

            If you click on the links in the menu, you should see that your browser path (the part after lowdefy.com) changes from `welcome` to `new-ticket`.

            ### What happened

            - We created a new page with id `new-ticket`.
            - We used a `_ref` operator to reference configuration in another file.
            - That page can now be found at the `/new-ticket` route.
            - A link to that page was created in the menu. These links are in the order of the pages.

            ## Menus

            A menu is created by default from all the pages in your app, in the order that they appear in the pages array. Often more control is needed over the menu. You might want to group menu items into different groups, change the title, exclude a page or add an icon. To do this, we can define a menu in the `menus` section of the `lowdefy.yaml` file.

            #### Step 1

            Copy the following:

            ```yaml
            ################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
            menus:
              - id: default
                links:
                  - id: welcome
                    type: MenuLink
                    properties:
                      icon: HomeOutlined
                      title: Home
                    pageId: welcome
                  - id: new-ticket
                    type: MenuLink
                    properties:
                      icon: AlertOutlined
                      title: New ticket
                    pageId: new-ticket
            ################ -------- Copy to here ---------- ################
            pages:
              - _ref: pages/welcome.yaml
                # ...
            ```

            The menu links will now have icons and titles.

            > If you would like to see how your config should look at this point, you can find it [here](tutorial-create-page-config).

            ### Up next

            In the next section we will add some more blocks to our page to create a form to capture the ticket data.

      - _ref:
          path: templates/navigation_buttons.yaml
          vars:
            previous_page_title: Development server
            previous_page_id: tutorial-development-server
            next_page_title: Adding blocks
            next_page_id: tutorial-add-blocks

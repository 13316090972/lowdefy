            A Lowdefy page is compiled out of a arrangement of blocks. Every HTML element of this page is render as a result of a block placed and configured on the page. Blocks make it simple for Lowdefy developers to create apps since they only have to decide what block type to use, where in the layout the block should render, and what the block should do by defining the block's `properties`. How a block implements these `properties` is up to the specific block type selected. 

            Lowdefy offers a list of over 30 block types to cater for a wide range of use cases. All blocks are categorized according to their primary function: 
            - `display` - Display page elements.
            - `input` - Modify a value in [`state`](/state-and-context).
            - `context` - Create a new [`context`](/state-and-context).
            - `container` - Render other blocks into [`content areas`](/layout).
            - `list` - Render [`content areas`](/layout) and blocks for each element in the data array.

            When `state` updates or a requests call completes, the Lowdefy engine reevaluates all operators and rerenders blocks for which the operator evaluation is different form the previous render result. The result is _live updates_  to all blocks on a page. Operators can be used to build _live update_ logic into all block fields, except for the `id`, `type`, `areas`, `blocks` and `loading` fields. 

            # Block Schema

            All Lowdefy blocks follow a __consistent__ root level schema with only 8 fields:

            - `id`: _String_ -  __Required__ - A unique identifier for a block. For `Input` blocks the block `id` sets the field key which the block will modify in [`state`](/state-and-context). Field _dot-notation_ can be used to express fields which are nested in objects or arrays.
            - `type`: _String_ -  __Required__ - The is the block type identifier and defines what block to used. The block type used must either be a default block type or must defined in your app's `types` configuration.
            - `properties`: _Object_ - All the settings passed to a block component.
            - `areas`: _Object_ - Used to set the content areas and content layout settings for `container`, `context` and `list` blocks. See [layout](/layout) for more details on how to use `areas`.
            - `blocks`: _Array_ - A array of blocks to render to the default `content` area for `container`, `context` and `list` blocks. See [layout](/layout) for more details on how to use the `blocks` array.
            - `events`: _Object_ - Used to set all the `events` of a block, used to define [`event`](/events-and-actions) [`actions`](/events-and-actions).
            - `layout`: _Object_ - Used to define the [layout](/layout) properties for a block. 
            - `loading`: _Object_ - Used to overwrite a block's default loading behavior. 
            - `required`: _Boolean_ | _Object_ - For `input` blocks, whether or not a value value is required in [`state`](/context-and-state) when the [`Validate`](/Validate) action is called. Can be either a boolean or an object of operators evaluating if a block is required or not.
            - `style`: _Css Object_ - Used to apply css style settings to the block's top level `div` element.
            - `validation`: _Array_ - A list of validation tests to pass when the [`Validate`](/Validate) action is called.
            - `visible`: _Boolean_ - Controls whether or not to render a block. This field can also be defined by operators which must evaluate to `false` to make the block invisible. Blocks with `visible: false` is excluded from [`state`](/state-and-context).

            # Block types

            Lowdefy has list of default block types as defined in the Lowdefy docs. The default Lowdefy blocks aim to cover a very generic implementation of the [Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/overview/) react component library. To use all the default block types, you can simply use the block `type` key, like [`Button`](/Button), [`TextInput`](/TextInput), [`Box`](/Box) and so on. 
            
            ###### Default block type config example:
            ```yaml
            lowdefy: LOWDEFY_VERSION
            pages:
              - id: example_dashboard
                type: PageHeaderMenu
                blocks:
                  - id: basic_chart
                    type: Button
                    properties:
                      # ... Button details
            ```

            However, the default types can overwritten or additional types can be define as required. For example, to set a `type` for a custom implementation of [AmCharts](https://www.amcharts.com/), we can do the following. We have created a custom [Lowdefy block for AmCharts v4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lowdefy/blocks-amcharts) that we can use. 
            
            ###### Custom block type config example:
            ```yaml
            lowdefy: LOWDEFY_VERSION
            types:
              AmChartsXY: 
                url: https://unpkg.com/@lowdefy/blocks-amcharts@latest/dist/meta/AmChartsXY.json
            pages:
              - id: example_dashboard
                type: Context
                blocks:
                  - id: basic_chart
                    type: AmChartsXY
                    properties:
                      # ... AmCharts details
            ```
            
            More details on custom blocks can be found [here](https://github.com/lowdefy/blocks-template). 

            # Block Loading

            Block loading renders a placeholder block while the block component is being fetched, or a block is waiting on a request to return before to rendering the block. This allows for a smoother user experience and reduces 'bounce' in the user interface as more blocks takes up their full width and height on the page while in a loading state.

            By default, Lowdefy tries to give a reasonable definition for how much space a block should take up in while loading, however this can vary depending on how the block is used. The `loading` property on blocks allows the Lowdefy developer to set a custom loading configuration for a block.

            ##### Custom block `loading` example:

            ```yaml
            pages:
              - id: page_one
                type: Context
                blocks:
                  # ...
                  - id: paragraph_one
                    type: Title
                    loading:
                      type: SkeletonParagraph
                      properties:
                        lines: 1
                    properties:
                      content: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
                  # ...
            ```

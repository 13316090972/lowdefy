            The Lowdefy CLI is used to develop a Lowdefy app locally, and to build Lowdefy apps for deployment.

            We recommend running the CLI using `npx`, to always use the latest version:

            ```
            npx lowdefy@latest <command>
            ```

            or, to use a specific version:

            ```
            npx lowdefy@version <command>
            ```

            Alternative, you can install the CLI globally or to a npm project (with a `package.json` file) via npm. The CLI can then be used using `lowdefy` as the executable name:

            ```
            lowdefy <command>
            ```

            # CLI commands

            ## build

            The `build` command runs a Lowdefy build. The options are:

            - `--base-directory <base-directory>`: Change base directory. The default is the current working directory.
            - `--output-directory <output-directory>`: Change the directory to which build artifacts are saved. The default is `<base-directory>/.lowdefy/build`.

            ## build-netlify
            The `build-netlify` command creates a production build for the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) web hosting service. It is designed to run as the Netlify build command.

            We recommend setting the build command to `npx lowdefy@latest build-netlify`. The Netlify publish directory should be set to `.lowdefy/publish`, and the functions directory set to `.lowdefy/functions`.

            - `--base-directory <base-directory>`: Change base directory. The default is the current working directory (The base directory should rather be configured in the Netlify build settings).

            ## clean-cache

            The Lowdefy CLI caches block metadata, and build and server scripts in the `.lowdefy/cache` directory. These cached files can be removed using the `clean-cache` command.

            - `--base-directory <base-directory>`: Change base directory. The default is the current working directory.

            ## dev

            The `dev` command starts a Lowdefy development server, running locally. It can be accessed in a browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The CLI watches the file system, and rebuilds the app and reloads served pages every time a change is made to any of the files in the project directory.

            - `--base-directory <base-directory>`: Change base directory. The default is the current working directory.
            - `--port <port>`: Change the port the server is hosted at. The default is `3000`.

            # Telemetry

            The CLI collects usage and error information to help us fix bugs, prioritize features, and understand how Lowdefy is being used.

            All telemetry can be disabled by setting the `disableTelemetry` flag in `cli` config object in your `lowdefy.yaml` file (this cannot be a reference to another file):

            ###### `lowdefy.yaml`
            ```yaml
            lowdefy: LOWDEFY_VERSION

            cli:
              disableTelemetry: true
            ```

            We collect the following information:

            - The CLI version.
            - The Lowdefy version of your app.
            - A random local app id (stored locally in your project folder at `.lowdefy/cli.json`).
            - The CLI command used.
            - If the CLI is being used in the Netlify CI environment (when using the `build-netlify` command).
            - Your IP address.
            - Error messages and stack traces for any errors.

            A Lowdefy block with category `context` provides the environment for a part of a Lowdefy app to run in. More than one context can be placed on a page, but generally only is need. The first block on a page should be a `context` category block. The standard page blocks like [`PageHeaderMenu`](/PageHeaderMenu) or [`PageSiderMenu`](/PageSiderMenu) are all `context` category blocks, and the [`Context`](/Context) block is a simple container that also provides a context.

            Each context provides encapsulation to the blocks inside it. It has it's own state object and requests.

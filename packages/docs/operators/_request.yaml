    description: |
      The `_request` operator returns the response value of a request. If the request has not yet been call, or is still executing, the returned value is `null`.

      It only returns true if all the values in the array are truthy (not `false`, `0`, `null`, `undefined`, or the empty string `""`). Else it returns false.

      ###### Using a request response:
      ```yaml
      _request: my_request
      ```
      Returns: The response returned by the request.
